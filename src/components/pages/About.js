			<p>
			Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Eric Wittenstein, and I'm looking to begin my career
            as a web developer. I'm currently enrolled in a "Coding Bootcamp" through Georgia Tech, finishing in early
            September, and will be using this webpage to showcase my completed projects and demonstrate my skills as a
            developer.
